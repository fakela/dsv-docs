# Release Notes

The July 2019 release of DevOps Secrets Vault marked the product’s first General Availability release.

Thycotic expects to periodically update DevOps Secrets Vault, such as to provide fixes and improvements or to introduce additional features. As a cloud application, DSV lacks version numbers, because updates become available to all users as they occur—the current version is always the only version available.

* However, users operate DSV through a Command Line Interface (CLI) provided by downloaded, locally installed, and OS-specific executables. These bear version numbers.
* Thycotic periodically updates these OS-specific executables to deliver fixes, improvements, and feature additions. You obtain these updated versions of the CLI executables by downloading them.
* Generally, older versions of CLI executables will continue to work, but you will want to have the latest executables to benefit from fixes and obtain new features.

This article includes a series of tables to track changes to DSV. The first table covers the cloud basis for DSV, and the others cover the OS-specific CLI executables and the API. In all the tables, the most recent changes appear first.

Remember, you can download the latest CLI executables [here](https://dsv.thycotic.com/downloads).
