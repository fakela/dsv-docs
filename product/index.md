# Welcome to DevOps Secrets Vault (DSV) Technical Assistance

New user? Make sure you have done all your setup and configuration steps.

*If you have **already** signed up for a vault, installed the CLI executable, and configured for your authentication provider, you’re good to go. If you have not completed any of those steps, please note the following to get started.*

The DevOps Secrets Vault service operates through two main components: a Cloud-hosted, API-driven vault that stores your Secrets, and a locally installed executable that gives you a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing your Secrets through the API. Neither works without the other, so you must set up both before you can use DevOps Secrets Vault. Additionally, once you are up and running, you must configure for your authentication provider.
