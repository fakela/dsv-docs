New user? Make sure you have done all your setup and configuration steps:

*If you have **already** signed up for a vault, installed the CLI executable, and configured for your authentication provider, you’re good to go—skip down to the next heading. If you have not completed any of these steps, please note the following to get started.*

The DevOps Secrets Vault service operates through two main components: a cloud-hosted, API-driven vault that stores your secrets, and a locally installed executable that gives you a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing your secrets through the API.

Neither works without the other, so you must set up both before you can use DevOps Secrets Vault. Additionally, once you are up and running, you must configure for your authentication provider.

* See the [Overview](./01-overview/index.md) for a quick product orientation.

* Visit [Obtain DevOps Secrets Vault](./02-obtain/index.md) to learn how to sign up for your Thycotic One cloud-hosted vault (the first main part) and download and place the CLI executable (the second main part).

* [Setup DevOps Secrets Vault](./03-setup/index.md) explains initial setup steps. Authentication figures prominently:

  * [Authentication: General](./04-authent-gen/index.md) covers typical installations.

  * [Authentication: Azure or AWS](./05-authent-azure-aws/index.md) covers use of DSV with third party authentication platforms.

When you have finished set up steps, don’t be finished with this doc resource--this collection is full of information about DevOps Secrets Vault and how to use it most effectively.

# About This Collection

This technical documentation collection for DevOps Secrets Vault (DSV) includes short, topically focused, technically oriented material, including product descriptions, diagrams, instructions, general guidance, and reference content. The collection includes two parts, Core and Extended:

* Core Document Collection articles form the basic documentation set and appear in the Navigation Panel at left, ordered as a DSV primer.

* The [Extended Document Collection](./9000-extended/) has not yet been populated. It will include KB-style articles, and may include training materials, user bulletins, and discussion threads.
 
* The search box at upper right provides direct access to articles relevant to your search terms. It pulls results from the entire collection, both Core and (eventually) Extended.

The Navigation Panel’s headings pull together information supporting a solid grounding in DevOps Secrets Vault. That includes the overview, setup, and configuration material linked above for new users, plus:

The [CLI Primer](./06-cli-primer/index.md), [CLI Examples](./07-cli-examples/index.md), and [CLI Reference](./08-cli-ref/index.md) articles cover the details of using DevOps Secrets Vault.

[Support Resources](./11-cust-support/index.md) connects you to available product support and provides [Release Notes](./11-cust-support/2110-release-notes.md).

[Quick Links](./16-quick-links/) lists for your convenience commonly used links related to DevOps Secrets Vault.

[Extended Document Collection](./9000-extended/) makes room for the forthcoming Extended Document Collection, which (as above) will include a range of materials, most significantly KB-style articles.

* Until this extended collection debuts, **Related documents** (the button at the top of the Navigation Panel) provides access to articles about the [Jenkins](/dsv-extension-jenkins) and [Kubernetes](/dsv-extension-kubernetes) extensions and the [DSV Java SDK](/dsv-sdk-java).
