# Welcome to DevOps Secrets Vault (DSV) Technical Assistance
 
New user? Make sure you have done all your setup and configuration steps:
 
*If you have **already** signed up for a vault, installed the CLI executable, and configured for your authentication provider, you’re good to go—skip down to the next heading. If you have not completed any of these steps, please note the following to get started.*
 
The DevOps Secrets Vault service operates through two main components: a cloud-hosted, API-driven vault that stores your secrets, and a locally installed executable that gives you a Command Line Interface (CLI) for managing your secrets through the API.

Neither works without the other, so you must set up both before you can use DevOps Secrets Vault. Additionally, once you are up and running, you must configure for your authentication provider.

* See the [Overview](./overview/index.md) for a quick product orientation.

* Visit [Obtain DevOps Secrets Vault](./obtain/index.md) to learn how to sign up for your Thycotic One cloud-hosted vault (the first main part) and download and place the CLI executable (the second main part).

* [Setup DevOps Secrets Vault](./setup/index.md) explains initial setup steps. Authentication figures prominently:

  * [Authentication: General](./authent-gen/index.md) covers typical installations.

  * [Authentication: Azure or AWS](./authent-azure-aws/index.md) covers use of DSV with third party authentication platforms.

When you have finished set up steps, don’t be finished with this doc resource—this collection is full of information about DevOps Secrets Vault and how to use it most effectively.
