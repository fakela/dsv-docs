# Release Notes

Thycotic periodically updates DevOps Secrets Vault, such as to provide fixes and improvements or to introduce additional features. As a Cloud application, DSV lacks version numbers, because updates become available to all users as they occur—the current version is always the only version available.

* However, users operate DSV through a Command Line Interface (CLI) provided by downloaded, locally installed, and OS-specific executables. These bear version numbers.
* Thycotic periodically updates these OS-specific executables to deliver fixes, improvements, and feature additions, as needed to keep the customer-side CLI executables conformant with the Cloud-based DSV service offerings.
* The version number will always be the same across the OS editions of the CLI executable; if a change resulting in a version number iteration only affects one of the OS editions, it will be noted, but all editions will still get the new version number.
* You obtain these updated versions of the CLI executables by downloading them from [DevOps Secrets Vault Downloads](https://dsv.thycotic.com/downloads).
* Generally, older versions of CLI executables will continue to work, but you will want to have the latest executables to benefit from fixes and obtain new features.

This article tracks changes to DSV. Highlights of the most recent update appear first. The same information appears in the tables that follow. The first table covers the Cloud basis for DSV, and the second covers the OS-specific CLI executables and the API. In both tables, the most recent changes appear first.

## November 2019 Release Notes Highlights

DSV now has a soft delete posture for most delete operations and offers increased availability and recoverability.

### Soft Delete

* When you delete a Secret, Role, User, Group, Policy, or Authentication Provider, as before it will no longer be usable.
* However, with DSV’s new soft delete posture, you have 72 hours to use the new `restore` command to undelete the item.
* After 72 hours, the item will no longer be retrievable.

You can still perform a hard delete that precludes any restore operation.

* Use the delete command’s `--force` flag to perform a hard delete.

### Improved Availability and Recoverability

Recent changes in DSV’s cloud architecture back uptime of 99.999 percent, with continuous backup enabling fail-over to a hot backup in under one minute. Updates to the EULA (your End User License Agreement) detail the new SLA for availability.

## DSV Cloud Service: Change Log

| **Update**             | **Notes**                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| November 2019          | **improvement**: after deleting a Secret, Role, User, Group, Policy, or Authentication Provider, the new `restore` command will undelete the item up to 72 hours later
|                        | **improvement**: architectural changes back uptime of 99.999 percent; continuous backup enables hot backup fail-over in under a minute |
|                        |      |
| October 2019           | **improvement**: a Secret’s data, attributes, and description can be individually updated via the *update* command’s new *--data*, *--attributes* and *--desc* flags, respectively |
|                        | **improvement**: the Secret *update* command’s new Boolean *--overwrite* flag controls whether the *--data* flag’s content overwrites or merges with extant data object fields |
|                        | **improvement**: improvement: updated server side policy caching to better handle permission updates |
|                        | **improvement**: the CLI now supports finding and examining audit logs, previously possible only via the API |
|                        |      |
| September 2019         | **improvement**: better scaling of configuration files achieved by keeping policies and authentication providers in separate files  |
|                        | **improvement**: the *permissions* command has been superseded by the *policy* command; named policies no longer require everyone to modify a global document |
|                        | **improvement**: the new Change Password feature enables users to change their passwords |
|                        | **improvement**: adding Users to a Group achieves permissions delegation |
|                        | **improvement**: deleting a Secret now deletes all past versions, rather than just the latest |
|                        | **fixed**: the API Audit Search function’s bug, related to the improperly named *Secret* parameter, is resolved by the properly named *path* parameter |
|                        |      |
| August 2019            | **fixed**: issue where the refresh token generated by Thycotic One authentication was not correctly generating the full subject name and could cause access denied errors |
|                        | **fixed**: issue where adding a pre-existing Thycotic One user as a DSV User would not correctly save the Thycotic One user id |
|                        | **fixed**: issue where the config created and updated metadata fields that were not properly shown in responses |
|                        | **added**: version validation to *config update* to help prevent conflicts |
|                        |      |
| July 2019              | first General Availability of the service  |
 

## DSV CLI Executables for Windows, Linux, and macOS: Version History

| **Version** | **Date**   | **Notes**  |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1.0.1       | 2019.08.15 | **fixed**: issue where the CLI returned an error when the stored refresh token had been invalidated and the current cached access token was expired |
|             |            | **improved**: when you upload a config document from a file via the *config update* command, the updated config from the Cloud is now saved back to the local file; this ensures the return to the User of any auto-generated IDs for the permission policies and settings |
|             |            | **fixed**: initialization issues with Windows Credential Manager and Linux Pass storage |
| 1.0.0       | 2019.07.23 | first General Availability of the service |
