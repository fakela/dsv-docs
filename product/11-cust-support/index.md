Support options depend on license status, with paid licenses having more support channels.

## Free Licenses

If you have a free license, use this document collection to find information about DSV and how to use it.

The [CLI Primer](./06-cli-primer/index.md), [CLI Examples](./07-cli-examples/index.md), and [CLI Reference](./08-cli-ref/index.md) articles pin out the details of using DevOps Secrets Vault.

The [Authentication: General](./04-authent-gen/index.md) covers typical installations, and the [Authentication: Azure or AWS](./05-authent-azure-aws/index.md) section covers use of DSV with third party authentication platforms.

## Paid DSV Licenses

Customers with paid licenses for DSV have access to support by phone and email. They also can open a case in Thycotic’s support ticketing system, which promotes follow-through to issue resolution.
