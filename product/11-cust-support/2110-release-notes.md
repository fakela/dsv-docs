# Release Notes

The July 2019 release of DevOps Secrets Vault marked the product’s first General Availability release.

  
---
  

Thycotic periodically updates DevOps Secrets Vault, such as to provide fixes and improvements or to introduce additional features. As a cloud application, DSV lacks version numbers, because updates become available to all users as they occur—the current version is always the only version available.

* However, users operate DSV through a Command Line Interface (CLI) provided by downloaded, locally installed, and OS-specific executables. These bear version numbers.

* Thycotic periodically updates these OS-specific executables to deliver fixes, improvements, and feature additions, as needed to keep the customer-side CLI executables conformant with the cloud-based DSV service offerings.

* The version number will always be the same across the OS editions of the CLI executable; if a change resulting in a version number iteration only affects one of the OS editions, it will be noted, but all editions will still get the new version number.

*You obtain these updated versions of the CLI executables by downloading them from [DevOps Secrets Vault Downloads](https://dsv.thycotic.com/downloads).

* Generally, older versions of CLI executables will continue to work, but you will want to have the latest executables to benefit from fixes and obtain new features.

| **Date**             | **Notes**                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| August 2019 Update   | fixed: issue where the refresh token generated by Thycotic One authentication was not correctly generating the full subject name and could cause access denied errors |
|                      | fixed: issue where adding a pre-existing Thycotic One user as a DSV user would not correctly save the Thycotic One user id |
|                      | fixed: issue where the config created and updated metadata fields that were not properly shown in responses |
|                      | added: version validation to **config update** to help prevent conflicts |

## DSV CLI Executables for Windows, Linux, and MacOS: Version History

  
---
  

| **Version** | **Date**   | **Notes**  |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1.0.1       | 2019.08.15 | fixed: issue where the CLI returned an error when the stored refresh token had been invalidated and the current cached access token was expired |
|             |            | improved: when you upload a config document from a file via the **config update** command, the updated config from the cloud is now saved back to the local file; this ensures the return to the user of any auto-generated IDs for the permission policies and settings |
|             |            | fixed: initialization issues with Windows Credential Manager and Linux Pass storage |
| 1.0.0       | 2019.07.23 | version coinciding with the July 2019 first General Availability of the DSV service |
