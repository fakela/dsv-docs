# DevOps Secrets Vault Java SDK

The DSV Java SDK is in pre-release and does not come with documentation. Thycotic intends it for technically mature organizations interested in creating their own extensions to integrate DSV into their infrastructure.

Thycotic will provide documentation with a later release of the SDK.

## Download the SDK

You can [download the DSV Java SDK](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.thycotic/devops-secrets-vault-sdk/1.0.0) from Thycotic’s Maven repository for DevOps Secrets Vault.
